> "To be or not to be?"

This is not a problem for me.
When I had lunch two days ago, I talked to my friends about life and death. A friend said that death is a very simple matter.

<!--more-->

Indeed, life is very fragile, and it is certain that death will happen in life.

However, it seems to me that being born to die is not a sad thing. Because knowing that it will end, it will cherish and enjoy the process of life.

**Why do I love life so much?**

I'm full of awe and longing when I live in this wonderful word.
When we think that we have a better understanding of the world, it is only a step closer to ignorance. Whenever I try to experience "reality", I always feel that the existence of my surroundings and myself is particularly illusory.
I really admire the warriors who are devoted to exploring the unknown.
Because of the desire to seek knowledge, we can overcome all fears.
On the way to knowing, you can see the different possibilities of the world. Even if you can't experience these possibilities in your limited life, after actually knowing the possibilities, it is not so important to experience the word. The most terrible thing in life is that there is only one kind of understanding of the world in our consciousness.
When I wrote this, I suddenly had an idea. Does the word "to know" is the behavior of exploring the possibilities of the world? Maybe God is really throwing a dice?

> "To be or not to be?"

对我来说这不是一个问题。
前两天吃午饭的时候，和朋友聊到了生和死相关的问题。朋友说，死亡是一件非常简单的事情。

的确啊，生命非常脆弱，并且人生里只有死亡这件事情是肯定会发生的。

不过在我看来，生而向死，并不是悲伤的事情。因为知道会终结，才会更珍惜和享受生命的过程。

**我为什么这么热爱生命?**
对这个世界，一定是充满敬畏和渴望的
当我们认为对这个世界更加了解的时候，其实只是向无知更近了一步。每当我试图去体会"真实"，反而总会觉得周围和自己的存在特别的虚幻。
真的很钦佩那些投身于探索未知的战士们，他们是顶着整个世界的蔑视眼光在前行
因为求知的欲望，能战胜一切恐惧。
求知的路上能看到世界不同的可能性。即使自己有限的生命里无法经历这些可能，但其实认识了各种可能性之后，体验这个词已经不那么重要了。生命里最可怕的事情就是，意识里对世界只有一种认识。
写到这突然有个想法，求知这个词会不会其实就是描述探索世界的各种可能性这个行为，因为或许上帝真是在掷色子呢?
